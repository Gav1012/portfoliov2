                Hey there, my name is Gavin! I am a graduate from the University of California Santa Cruz with a Bachelors in Computer Science. My 
                experience as a developer primarily has come from developing full-stack web applications, contributing to the frontend and backend. 
                I am currently at SpaceLab, volunteering as a front end developer providing my experience and improving my skills as a developer.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl max-w-6xl mx-auto">
                Right now, I am actively searching for a software developer position where I can grow my skillset and contribute to more projects. In 
                the meantime I am currently improving my skills as a developer and knowledge on the topics of AI and machine learning.
