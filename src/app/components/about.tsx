                Hey, I’m Gavin! I'm a graduate from the University of California Santa Cruz with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. Most of my experience
                as a developer has come from developing full-stack web applications on the frontend and the backend. I am currently 
                volunteering for SpaceLab as a front end developer providing my experience as well as improving my skills with front-end development. 
                Currently I have been looking into learning more about topics relating to cloud development, AI, and machine learning.
