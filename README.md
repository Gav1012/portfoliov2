## About
This is my second edition of my portfolio website. The goal of this website's creation process is to be a single page website that
uses a new front end technology with Next.js, a framework I haven't used before. Another thing I want to experiment with is more 
creativity in terms of design, as I want the website to be more eye popping and nice to look at compared to v1 of my portfolio.

Tech Stack: TypeScript, React, Next.js, TailwindCSS
