# portfoliov2
This is my second edition of my portfolio website. The goal of this website's creation process is to be a single page website that \
uses a new front end technology, looking currently at Next.js. Another thing I want to experiment with is more creativity in terms \
of design, as I want the website to be more eye popping and nice to look at compared to v1 of my portfolio.
