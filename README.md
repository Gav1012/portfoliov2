## About
This is my second edition of my portfolio website. The goal of this website's creation process is to be a single page website that
uses a new front end technology, looking currently at Next.js. Another thing I want to experiment with is more creativity in terms
of design, as I want the website to be more eye popping and nice to look at compared to v1 of my portfolio.
Will definitely be looking at free stylish components and such for this website.

Tech Stack: TypeScript, React, Next.js, TailwindCSS
## Getting Started (will update later)
```bash
npm run dev
```
